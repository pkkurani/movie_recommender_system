# Movie-Recommendation

This is a movie recommender system where one can get recommendations based on genre and movie name. I have used TF-IDF vectorizer for vectorization, cosine similarity to calculate simialrity between vectors and TMDB's api to fetch information about the movies and streamlit to create the front end of the website. 

To run the app: streamlit run file_name.py
